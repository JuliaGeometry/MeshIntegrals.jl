# Support Matrix

While this library aims to support all possible integration rules and [**Meshes.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl)
geometry types, some combinations are ill-suited and some others are simply not yet
implemented. The following Support Matrix aims to capture the current development state of
all geometry/rule combinations. Entries with a green check mark are fully supported
and have passing unit tests that provide some confidence they produce accurate results.

In general, Gauss-Kronrod integration rules are recommended (and the default) for geometries
with one parametric dimension, e.g.: `Segment`, `BezierCurve`, and `Rope`. Gauss-Kronrod
rules can also be applied to some geometries with more dimensions by nesting multiple
integration solves, but this is inefficient. These Gauss-Kronrod rules are supported (but
not recommended) for surface-like geometries, but not for volume-like geometries. For
geometries with more than one parametric dimension, e.g. surfaces and volumes, H-Adaptive
Cubature integration rules are recommended (and the default).
