# Support Matrix

This library aims to enable users to calculate the value of integrals over all [**Meshes.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Meshes.jl)
geometry types using an array of numerical integration rules and techniques. However, some
combinations of geomtry types and integration rules are ill-suited, and some others are simply
not yet yet implemented. The following Support Matrix captures the current state of support for
all geometry/rule combinations. Entries with a green check mark are fully supported and pass
unit tests designed to check for accuracy.

In general, Gauss-Kronrod integration rules are recommended (and the default) for geometries
with one parametric dimension, e.g.: `Segment`, `BezierCurve`, and `Rope`. or geometries with
more than one parametric dimension, e.g. surfaces and volumes, H-Adaptive Cubature rules are
recommended (and the default).

While it is possible to apply nested Gauss-Kronrod rules to numerically integrate geometries
with more than one parametric dimension, this produces results that are strictly inferior to
using an equivalent H-Adaptive Cubature rule, so support for this usage is not recommended.
