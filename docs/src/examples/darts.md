# Darts (Draft)

Steps
- Comstruct a set of geomtries representimg a dartboard with individual sector scores
- Develop a model of the dart trajectory with probability density distribution
- Use integration over each geometry to determine the probabilities of particular outcomes
- Calculate expected value for the throw, repeat for other distributions to compare strategies
