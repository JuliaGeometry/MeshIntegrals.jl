#                   Specialized Methods for BezierCurve
#
# Why Specialized?
#   The parametric function in Meshes.jl for BezierCurve accepts an argument
#   of type Meshes.BezierEvalMethod, in which the method for generating
#   parametric points along the curve is specified. These specialized methods
#   are essentially identical to the generic ones, except that they provide a
#   keyword argument and pass through the specified algorithm choice.

Like [`integral`](@ref) but integrates along the domain defined a `curve`. By
default this uses Horner's method to improve performance when parameterizing
the `curve` at the expense of a small loss of precision. Additional accuracy
can be obtained by specifying the use of DeCasteljau's algorithm instead with
`alg=Meshes.DeCasteljau()` but can come at a steep cost in memory allocations,
especially for curves with a large number of control points.
